Note: This is my first ever Python project. 
This program calculates the total cost of an item using Canada's tax rates from 2020. 
Note that this program was created in 2020, therefore the tax rates may differ from the current tax rates in Canada, resulting
in this calculator to be inaccurate. 

When you run this program, it will allow you to decide which province or territory you are in.
Each province or territory listed has a square bracket next to it, with a number inside it. 
When the program asks you to choose where you live, you simply type the number inside the square bracket which is next to the province or territory of your choice.
(If you choose the wrong province or territory, you can simply restart the program.)

The program will then ask you for the price of the item, do not include the "$" when entering the price.
Then the program will calculate the total cost of your item with the tax rates from your chosen province or territory.
